      <p class="two">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the . <span>css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</span> Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser r screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

      <p class="four">In 1980, physicist Tim Bemers-Lee. a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents <span class="five">1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.Bemers-Lee specified HTMIL and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.</span> That year, Bermers-Lee and CERN data systems cngincer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry. The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.It describes 18 clements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTMI. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMIguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN, Eleven of these elements still exist in HIML 4.</p>
