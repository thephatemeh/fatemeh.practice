Voldemort has hidden parts of his soul in multiple Horcruxes, which need to be destroyed to weaken him and ultimately defeat him. At the beginning of the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are tasked with locating and destroying these Horcruxes, and they are largely guided by the memories and information Harry has obtained from Professor Dumbledore, who had been killed in the previous book.The trio’s quest leads them to various places, from the Ministry of Magic to Godric’s Hollow, and eventually to a mysterious part of the magical world known as the Room of Requirement.
