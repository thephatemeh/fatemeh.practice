    <p>here is the quote from WikiPedia:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting">Painting is an important form of visual art, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction.Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).</blockquote>
